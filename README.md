***Animals-10 Dataset: Data Preprocessing & Neural Network Training***

**Overview:**
This project focuses on analyzing, preprocessing, and training a deep learning model on the Animals-10 dataset. 
The Animals-10 dataset consists of 10 classes of animals. 
The dataset was taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessiocorrado99/animals10/data
The dataset is split into 70% training and 30% testing. 

**Installation and setup:**
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/lizabazil/animals-10-classifier.git
cd animals-10-classifier
```
2. Install Dependencies Using Pipenv:
ensure you have pipenv installed on your machine. If not, install it using the following command:
```
pip install pipenv
```
3. Then, navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the dependencies from Pipfile:
```
pipenv install
```
4. Activate the Virtual Environment:
```
pipenv shell
```
5. Launch Jupyter Notebook
```
jupyter notebook
```
6. Open the notebook.
Once Jupyter Notebook is running, open the *classifier.ipynb* file and execute the cells to preprocess data.

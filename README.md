***Animals-10 Dataset: Data Preprocessing & Neural Network Training***

**Overview:**
This project focuses on analyzing, preprocessing, and training a deep learning model on the Animals-10 dataset. 
The Animals-10 dataset consists of 10 classes of animals. 
The dataset was taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessiocorrado99/animals10/data
The dataset is split into 70% training and 30% testing. 

There are 4 notebooks in this project: 
- preprocess (for analyzing the dataset)
- basic_cnn (basic convolutional neural network with accuracy 73%)
- improving_cnn (more robust model; the architecture and way of training were changed, and F1-score is 90%)
- task_4 (using pretrained model (resnet), the F1-score is 96%) 

**Installation and setup:**
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/lizabazil/animals-10-classifier.git
cd animals-10-classifier
```
2. Open notebooks.
